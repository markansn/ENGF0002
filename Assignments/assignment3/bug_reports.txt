Frog can 'fly' if foward is held down
Invisible third turtles
Leftmost win spot doesn't work

<<<<<<<<<Bug 1>>>>>>>>>>

Summary: Lives drained when frog hits car / falls into lake.

Description: Once the frog has been hit by a car, the death animation is displayed. Afterwards it seems that the frog briefly reappears, another life is lost, and the process repeats again until all lives are lost. 

What should happen: The frog should return to the beginning of the level with one life lost.

To reproduce: Get the frog to be hit by a car.

Explanation: When the frog is hit / falls in the water, the position of the frog is never reset, so it continually dies until the player runs out of lives.

Solution: After the frog has died, and the death animation has played out, the reset_position() function in the model can be called. 
In view:
    def check_undead(self, time_now):
        if time_now - self.died_time < 1:
            #still dead
            return
        self.dead = False
        self.frog.reset_position()
        self.canvas.delete(self.items[0])
        self.items.clear()
        self.draw()

<<<<<<<<<<Bug 2>>>>>>>>>>

Summary: Frog cannot hop onto the turtles.

Description: When the frog hops onto a turtle, the game seems to act like it has hit the water and the frog dies.

What should happen: The frog should be able to sit on the turtles.

To reproduce: Attempt to get the frog to hop onto the turtles.

Explination: Due to a simple typo in check_frog_crossing_river(), the value of on_log is never changed and is always none, so even if the frog is on the log it still dies.

Solution: Fix typo. Line 374
                if log.contains(self.frog):
                    on_log = log
                    print("here")
                    break


<<<<<<<<<<Bug 3>>>>>>>>>>

Summary: Frog can float above the water on the end of a log object.

Description: The frog can hang off the end of a log as long as a tiny bit of it is touching the rightmost side of the log.

What should happen: If the frog is not compleatly within the bounds of the log, the frog should die.

To reproduce: Hop onto a log in such a way to clip the rightmost hand side of the log, the frog however does not die. 

Explination: This bug is due to the nature of the way coordinates are handled by the game. As the coordinates of the frog start at the leftmost side of the frog. The problem is the bounds of the log are not correctly checked against the position of the frog.

Solution: 

    def contains(self, frog):
        (frog_x, frog_y) = frog.get_position()
        

        if frog_y != self.y or frog_x < self.x-20 or frog_x > self.x + self.width - 20:
        
            return False

        return True
