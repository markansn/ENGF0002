Bug Reports assignment 3

Bug 1

Summary: Lives drained when frog hits car / falls into lake.

Description: Once the frog has been hit by a car, the death animation is displayed. Afterwards it seems that the frog briefly reappears, another life is lost, and the process repeats again until all lives are lost. 

What should happen: The frog should return to the beginning of the level with one life lost.

To reproduce: Get the frog to be hit by a car.

Explanation: When the frog is hit / falls in the water, the position of the frog is never reset, so it continually dies until the player runs out of lives.

Solution: After the frog has died, and the death animation has played out, the reset_position() function in the model can be called. 
In view:
    def check_undead(self, time_now):
        if time_now - self.died_time < 1:
            #still dead
            return
        self.dead = False
        self.frog.reset_position()
        self.canvas.delete(self.items[0])
        self.items.clear()
        self.draw()

Bug 2

Summary: Frog cannot hop onto the turtles.

Description: When the frog hops onto a turtle, the game seems to act like it has hit the water and the frog dies.

What should happen: The frog should be able to sit on the turtles.

To reproduce: Attempt to get the frog to hop onto the turtles.

Explination: Due to a simple typo in check_frog_crossing_river(), the value of on_log is never changed and is always none, so even if the frog is on the log it still dies.

Solution: Fix typo. Line 374
                if log.contains(self.frog):
                    on_log = log
                    print("here")
                    break
